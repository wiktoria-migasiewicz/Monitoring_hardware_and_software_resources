# Monitoring_hardware_and_software_resources
A program for collecting information about computer hardware (for the project this will be one machine) whose purpose is collecting information about operating systems and installed software and their versions, in order to verify whether there is any software on the computers particularly susceptible to exposure.
This program, written in Python, consists of two elements: a client part that will download information about a given machine and the server part which stores data of a specific machine.
